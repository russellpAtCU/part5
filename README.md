# part5

The hardest part of part 5 was definitly enabling the user to input via the keyboard. 
I chose 100 for the slider because I felt that any less would be useless and any more would mean that it would be too difficult to select the right number.
At first I debated between grid and vbox + hbox but in the end vbox + hbox seemed easier and so that is what I chose to use.
As added functions the enter key functions as an equals and the 'c' key functions as clear key.
